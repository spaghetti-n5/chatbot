# chatbot
Implementation of a chatbot in ReactJS.

A simple chatbot that helps the user to find the product they are interested in and suggest them an appropriate plan.

The bot will follow a basic conversation divided in steps. In each step the bot will get meaningful data from the user input: name, categories of technologies of interest, preferred product and he will suggest the user a proper subscription plan for the selected item. 

Here you can see some screenshots of the running App.
